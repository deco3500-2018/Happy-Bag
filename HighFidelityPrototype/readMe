This file folder(HighFidelity Prototype) is used to store all files about high fidelity prototype, 
in each specific folder you can find related images which are used in making high fidelity prototype.

The "index.html" should be the start page of our prototype, and it should only has one css file and one JS file linked to.

The ".zip" file includes all files about our high fidelity prototype, 
if you want to see our prototype on your own computer (rather than using github), just download it.

Thank you~
